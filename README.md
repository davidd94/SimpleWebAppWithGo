# Purpose #

Generally to learn how to create a simple Web Applications using net/http package. My goal is to practice creating data structures, handle http requests, error handling, template caching, validation and using function literals or lambdas in python terms :)

Even though go routines/concurrencies/channels are not part of this tutorial, I will attempt to implement something to practice it.
